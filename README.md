# EE689-Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks

Readme page about my assignments and projects for phd level deep learning course at Bogazici University. 

All codes are crafted and reported in google colab format with python. As they are old and also being my first py scripts, please considered it as an intern code.

Regardless of the quality in code, please enjoy my agony in all of those fine tuning models and reports as I did not enjoyed it writing but happy from the outcome :)

**Final Project**
