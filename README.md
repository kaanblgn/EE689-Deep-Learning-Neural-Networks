🚀 The Chronicles of My Deep Learning Odyssey at Bogazici University: A 2024 Retrospective 🚀



Flashback to 2021, when I was knee-deep in my PhD-level deep learning course at Bogazici University. 📚💻



Final Project: U-net Extravaganza for Structure (Building) Segmentation Using Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset



Back in the day, this project was my master's thesis' opening act. Picture this: a clever U-net model trying to make sense of a limited dataset (less than 32 inputs). It's like watching a maestro conduct an orchestra with a kazoo, but hey, it worked! 🏗️🛰️



Assignments - A Trip Down Memory Lane:



1. Solving XOR: The Classic Headache

Remember the XOR algorithm? Yeah, the one that sounds like a secret code for a treasure hunt. I tackled it like a champ, showcasing my 'state-of-the-art' code in Python 3 without the fancy deep learning libraries. It might be my cleanest report, but back then, it felt like I was unraveling the mysteries of the universe. 😅🧠



2. Classifying Handwritten Digits: From Scribbles to Recognition



Handwritten digits and neural networks - a match made in 'what-was-I-thinking' heaven. This assignment proves that even the weirdest data types can be tamed by the mighty deep learning models. Fun and fundamental.



3. Text Generation with RNN: Because News Speakers Need Company



Text generation with Recurrent Neural Networks - where the news speaker's voice meets my code. It's almost like having a conversation with a text generator - slightly surreal and absolutely entertaining. 📰✨

Fast forward to 2024, and let's just say I've evolved into a software developer extraordinaire. Gone are the days of agony; now, it's all about those elegant solutions and pristine code. 💼💻



If you want a chuckle (or a cringe), dive into my GitHub time capsule. The codes are there, untouched since 2021, like artifacts from a bygone era. Python 3, Google Colab, and a sprinkle of satirical humor - because who said deep learning can't be fun? 🐍😄

Feel free to explore the relics of my past self. Here's to growth, laughter, and the endless adventures of a software developer in the making! 🌐💡 #DeepLearningChronicles #SoftwareDevelopmentGlowUp #NeuralNostalgia #GitHubTimeCapsule #2024Journey
